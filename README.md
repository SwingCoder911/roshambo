App to play rock paper scissors

## Intro
This is a super fun app just made to play a basic game of rock paper scissors meant to be extendable to more options and more players
Next step is Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock!

## Testing
There's a couple tests using mocha for some basic testing, but there's a lot that still needs to be stubbed out.
Each class and component needs to have it's own test with golden path testing and smoke testing of all nasty in puts

## Todo
- Add best x out of y options
- Add number of players
- Add more options to pick from
